# exl_project
A GitHub repository aimed at evaluating the accuracy of existing data regarding sexual violence.

Requirements:

Python 3,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Geopandas.

About The Study:

This research project is conducted under Renaissance Learning. The study compares three different government agencies and their existing estimates regarding sexual violence. We analyze each agency individually to ascertain trends, and then analyzed them in comparison with one another to evaluate accuracy.

Notebooks:

The notebooks are separated by the data set they are analyzing, whether that be from the CDC, FBI, or DOJ, and what year they are applicable to.

The majority of the notebooks contain analysis and visualizations applied to individual agency data, however a few are comparing the different agencies to one another.

Data:

We conduct basic data handling using Python libraries to clean up data and visualize it properly. We incorporate line plots and stacked bar charts as well as correlation matrices and linear regressions to display our data and draw conclusions about trends. Our data has limitations, most glaringly in the comparisons drawn between the different agencies.

Acknowledgements:

A special thank you to Jackie Malooly, Justin Alt, and Jon Stelman, as well as the whole of Renaissance Learning for creating the opportunity for this research and guiding it every step of the way.
